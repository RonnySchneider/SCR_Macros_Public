## Explode
### SCR_ExplodeAlignlabelToText
* TBC’s built-in “Explode” can’t explode Alignment Labels
* but it can be handy to use the Alignment Labeling to have some text nicely spaced along an Alignment
* afterwards use this macro to explode it into single texts, which then can be changed via the Properties Pane or SCR_SNRText
### SCR_ExplodeCADLeader
* for better Propeller visualization
* converts Text Leaders into simple string lines
* used in combination with “SCR_SaveRestoreLabelPositions”
